## Introduction

In this project, I will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

## Problem Statement

My goal is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where I live.

## Part 2: Data Analysis

Distribution of hourly entries when calculated on the basis of raining condition
gives some interesting results.

This distribution is highly right-skewed for both the cases. Hourly entries are
significantly higher when it doesn't rain. It means more people use the subway
when the sky is clear.
