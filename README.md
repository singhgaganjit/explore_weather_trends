## Introduction

In this project, I will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

<a id="problem"></a>

## Problem Statement

My goal is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where I live.

## Software Requirements

This project uses Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets for creating the visualisations and analysis.

## Conclusion

The temperatures in both the global level and local level have certainly gone up. If we compare the recorded local and global temperature in 1796 and the one in 2013, there is an increase of over 1 degree Celsius. This trend can be seen if you compare the MA as well of the respective years.
